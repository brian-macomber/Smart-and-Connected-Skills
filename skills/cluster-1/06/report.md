### Skill 06 - Console I/O

##### Brian Macomber

For this skill it takes input from the keyboard and evaluates it once the user presses enter. It can switch between 3 modes: toggle the onboard LED on or off by pressing 't', echo what the user types in, convert integers to hexidecimal (if the user enters something that is not a number, it will give 0).
