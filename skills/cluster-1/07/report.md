### Skill 07 - Use GPIO to control LEDs

##### Brian Macomber

For this skill I wired the circuit as shown below, with each LED going to a GPIO pin that is output capable.
The program to count in binary uses a for loop to count from 0 to 15, then it converts that iterator variable to an array of numbers corresponding to the 4 LEDS for binary counting.
