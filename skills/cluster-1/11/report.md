### Skill 11 - Stopwatch

##### Brian Macomber

For this skill, I combined the use of the I2c display, button input, and timer interrupts. I use a global variable counter for the display to constantly show, and the alarm will go off every second to increment this global variable. When the button is presssed, the counter is reset back to 0.
