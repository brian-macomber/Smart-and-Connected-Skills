### Skill 13 - Thermistor

##### Brian Macomber

In this skill I used the same voltage divider circuit for the thermistor, except I used a 10 kilo-ohm resistsor so that the output voltage of the thermistor is not too large and this is also accordance with reference material given in the skill. I first found the resistance of the thermistor by using ohm's law and setting the equation equal to the unknown resistance. I then used the Thermistor Equation along with 25 degrees celcius at 10,000 Ohms as a reference point.
