### Skill 14 - Ultrasonic Range Sensor

##### Brian Macomber

In this skill I wired the Ultrasonic Sensor user an ADC pin. To accurately read a value from the ADC input I sampled it 100 times every 2 seconds and took the average. I then converted this to a voltage, and converted this votlage to a distance using information from the data sheet (3.3V supply yields ~6.4mV/in). I started with this value, then adjusted it by a little bit to make my sensor reading more accurate.
