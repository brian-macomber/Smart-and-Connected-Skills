### Skill 16 - Node.js

##### Brian Macomber

For this skill, I downloaded and installed Node.js to run javascript code on the node.js server. In the images folder there are various screenshots of the browser where I hosted the web server. Lastly to read from the serial port, I used the serialport library installed using npm along with the parser-readline package to read what is transmitted from the esp-32 connected to the ultrasonic sensor.
