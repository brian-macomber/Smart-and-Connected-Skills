### Skill 17 - CanvasJS

##### Brian Macomber

For this skill, I first used the express package to host the webpage locally on port 8080. I use one method to display index.html where the CanvasJS graph is located, then another method to read each line of the csv and parse it into JSON to be recieved from a GET request to /data.
