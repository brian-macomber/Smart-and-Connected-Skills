### Skill 18 - Raspberry Pi

##### Brian Macomber

For this skill, I followed the instructions to format the SD card and install the OS for the raspberry pi. I then set up the wifi and enabled SSH so I can access the pi from the terminal on my laptop. I installed node.js on the pi and used scp to copy over a test http file to run on the pi. I ran the file on the pi and then navigated to the IP in a browser on my laptop and saw the "hello world" appear.
