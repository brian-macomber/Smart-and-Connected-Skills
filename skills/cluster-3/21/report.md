### Skill 21 - Pi Web Cam

##### Brian Macomber

After following the instructions to install packages and set up the pi, I ran `sudo service motion start` after powering on the pi with the web cam plugged in, and navigated to post 8081 on the pi's IP. Shown in the picture is the same webpage but port 8081 is forwarded to port 1132 seen here: http://team3ec444.ddns.net:1132
