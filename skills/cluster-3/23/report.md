### Skill 23 - Accelerometer

##### Brian Macomber

For this skill, I used the example code given as a starting point, then filled in the appropriate read and write functions using knowledge from the i2c display skill (creating an i2c command and accessing registers). For the getAccel function, I completed the read16 function to read from the registers using hints from whizzer, then lastly I filled out the function that calcuates roll and pitch using equations given from a website resource on whizzer as well.
