### Skill 25 - IR TX/RX

##### Brian Macomber

For this skill, I adapted my code from IR Traffic light code so that the LED changing was not on a timer, but on a button press. The first button will let the user cycle through the LED colors, and the second button will actually send the data over IR to another fob.
