### Skill 30 - The Crawler

##### Brian Macomber

For this skill, I wired up the esc and the steering servo up to the ESP32. I powered the ESP from a portable battery, and used the 5V out from the ESC to power the steering servo. The buggy should speed up to a constant speed for 5 seconds, then slow down to stop. While this is happening, the steering servo also turns the wheels through their full motion, then back to center. These two tasks will repeat over and over for this example code.
